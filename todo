# 1 ensure that the transaction has actually been completed

ebay sends notification when payment complete is marked by the buyer on it's side
this does not necessarily mean that the user has actually paid for the item

<eBayPaymentStatus>PayPalPaymentInProcess</eBayPaymentStatus>

PayPalPaymentInProcess
(out) The payment from buyer to seller is in PayPal process, but has not yet been completed.

For this I need to use IPN from paypal....

This opens up some other features...
If the buyer does not pay with paypal then we cannot use IPN
The seller must be notified by SMS to check to see whether they received payment
Then they must send an SMS to confirm payment and get the product shipped...

# 2 fix hack in meh_steps simply replacing the file contents of the raw xml

Let's use REXML instead
